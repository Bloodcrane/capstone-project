    "text": "In the village of Chkhakoura, the compact settlement of the population who migrated from Zemoachara began at the beginning of the 20th century. One of the first settlers was Suleiman Beridze, the ancestor of our family, who purchased land plots between 1913 and 1915 from Ivane Sikos dze Eristavi, the prince of the Fartkhmi community residing in Chokhatauri. This is confirmed by documents from that time, some of which are now museum exhibits, with a portion of them belonging to our family. Presently, we represent the fifth generation of the Suleiman Beridze lineage."
